# Arbitrary-precision-calculator
The Arbitrary Precision Calculator project performs mathematical operations (like addition, subtraction, etc.) on numbers larger than standard data types can handle. It uses linked lists, stacks, or arrays to store and manipulate each digit of large numbers. This enables accurate calculation of values with hundreds or thousands of digits.
